        <p>This week, we had a meeting to discuss changes we wanted to make to the animatic — at first choosing a transition that focused on the lazy Susan spinning faster and faster until the old man returns to the food court. Ultimately, after class, we decided to revert back to an abrupt cut to the food court. Below is a series of screenshots from our meeting notes.</p>

        <p>I worked on the moodboards by compiling reference photos for the characters, environments, and props. I also contributed to the asset list by inputting characters, props, and specific dishes from the Shanghai area and adding their respective descriptions. </p>
        <div class="date">October 2, 2020</div>
        <p>I drew some food prop designs, specifically the pi dan tofu dish from the flashback and the food court noodles:</p>

        <p>For the animatic, we discussed feedback from lecture about having Mr. Su take an action in the end. Some of my teammates liked the idea, but personally, I disagreed with it and explained to them why I felt this way: "To be honest, having the ending change in a way where the Mr. Su takes an action bothers me a little bit. And at first I couldn’t figure out why — it’s not just because of timing, or because it’s too much work — but I think it bothers me because at its core, adding this element of morality would fundamentally change the spirit of the character. This is a man who is lonely — and we don’t know how long he’s been lonely for, but if he is a man who has been feeling this way for some time, I cannot see what part of his character would motivate this change to talk to someone new. From the beginning, we see that he is unhappy with his situation (looking sad, sighing). People who are lonely are often lonely for a reason, and it is a feeling that builds over time. Having Mr. Su reach out to a stranger (even if it is so small as a wave), in a public place no less, is an extremely outgoing action that doesn’t seem very realistic, and it doesn’t seem in line with how we’ve established him as a character. While I think it is a good idea since it makes him more active, I am just not sure it is the one for this short. To me, this short is more about possibility than actuation, that even in a food court mall in a foreign country, someone’s life could be capable of change. I think having the two men smile at each other is subtle and effective without feeding the audience hand-to-mouth. I also like that Mr. Fu is very jolly rather than sad— because then it is in his character to sit next to someone completely random and make a new friend."</p>
