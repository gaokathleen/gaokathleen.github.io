        <p>This week I did a second pass of the single lantern and a first pass of the triple lantern:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/lantern_passtwo.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/triple_lanterns_pass1.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I shaded some other flashback food props such as the fish and the spring rolls:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fish_shaded_pass1.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/spring_rolls_shaded.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I also did a first pass of some general flashback props such as the wicker chair, the jar, the umbrella, and the flashback chopsticks:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/wicker_chair.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/jar.png" />
            
        </div>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/umbrella_shaded.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/flashback_chopsticks.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I did a second pass of the food court round table by adding in specularity — there's still not too huge of a change though, so it will need a third pass.</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/round_table_pass2.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I also took on doing the floor tiles of the food court:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/floors.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Finally, I wrapped up this week by shading some food court props — the trash station, the lamp, a food container, and the food court chopsticks. I modeled a burger and some fries to go into the food container, but to be honest I've been having a hard time with shading and ran out of time this week to do them. I'll definitely have everything finished by the final!</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 50%" src="assets/img/cnm/trash_can.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/lamp.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/container_pass1.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/foodcourt_chopsticks.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="date">November 20, 2020</div>
        <p>I started shading this week, doing a first pass of the single lantern:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/lantern_pass1.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I also shaded the food court tables:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/square_table.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/round_table_pass1.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Finally, I did a first pass of the duck — I had trouble getting the cilantro shaded without the whole scene coming up empty in the test render, however, so for the first pass I just took it out.</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/duck_shaded.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="date">November 14, 2020</div>
        <p>I used MASH dynamics to arrange scallions on top of the fish dish:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fishdish1.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fishdish2.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I also modeled some spring rolls, first using MASH dynamics to have them rest on top of the plate (image on the left). However, since Mai Siu would more likely carefully place the spring rolls, I revised this dish to have hand-placed rolls (image on the right). However, I think the tower arrangement might be too high right now.</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/rolls1.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/rolls2.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="date">November 6, 2020</div>
        <p>I tried out ZBrush for the first time and sculpted the fish for the flashback:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fish1.png" />
        </div>
        <p>After crit, I modified it to look chunkier and more stylized to fit the short.</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fish2.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fish3.png" />
        </div>
        <div>I also modeled some salt props for the food court, making a hamburger meal and some fries.</div>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/burger.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/fries.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="date">October 30, 2020</div>
        <p>This week I modeled some salt props — the umbrella for the flashback and the ketchup bottle for the food court:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/umbrella.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/ketchup.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I began to model the salted duck:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/duck_model.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I'm also working on some cilantro to put in the middle of the dish and also to sprinkle on other dishes. It's currently still in progress, as my first attempt with paint effects failed and all I did was draw a hairy arm paint effect all over my scene. I then realized that any cilantro would be very small if it made it to the final cut, and now I am trying to box model a very low-poly leaf. </p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/arm.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/ahh.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="date">October 23, 2020</div>
        <p>I revised the square food court table model, updating it so it looked larger and flatter:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/revised_table.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I also drew some environment designs to explore salt props for the restaurant:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/thumbnail.jpg" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/restaurant.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>We then decided to change the flashback to take place in Mr. Su's home, so I designed another layout and added a perspective version to the animatic:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/home.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/animatic.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="date">October 16, 2020</div>
        <p>I continued to work on food prop preproduction, drawing designs for the crab, lionshead meatballs, and salted duck dishes.</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 25%" src="assets/img/cnm/kathleen_crabs.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/kathleen_lionshead.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/duck.png" />
        </div>
        <p>We began modeling this week, and for the first pass I modeled the food court square table.</p>
        <img style="width: 40%; margin-left: 300px;" src="assets/img/cnm/square.png" />
        <p>I also contributed to the Character Backstory by providing a rough outline for Mr. Su and Mr. Fu. We had then had a meeting to hash out the specific details.</p>
        
        <div class="date">October 9, 2020</div>
        <p>I drew some food prop designs, specifically the pi dan tofu dish from the flashback and the food court noodles:</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/kathleen_pi_dan_tofu.png" />
            <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/kathleen_food_court_noodles.png" />
        </div>
        <p>For the animatic, we discussed feedback from lecture about having Mr. Su take an action in the end. Some of my teammates liked the idea, but personally, I disagreed with it and explained to them why I felt this way: "To be honest, having the ending change in a way where the Mr. Su takes an action bothers me a little bit. And at first I couldn’t figure out why — it’s not just because of timing, or because it’s too much work — but I think it bothers me because at its core, adding this element of morality would fundamentally change the spirit of the character. This is a man who is lonely — and we don’t know how long he’s been lonely for, but if he is a man who has been feeling this way for some time, I cannot see what part of his character would motivate this change to talk to someone new. From the beginning, we see that he is unhappy with his situation (looking sad, sighing). People who are lonely are often lonely for a reason, and it is a feeling that builds over time. Having Mr. Su reach out to a stranger (even if it is so small as a wave), in a public place no less, is an extremely outgoing action that doesn’t seem very realistic, and it doesn’t seem in line with how we’ve established him as a character. While I think it is a good idea since it makes him more active, I am just not sure it is the one for this short. To me, this short is more about possibility than actuation, that even in a food court mall in a foreign country, someone’s life could be capable of change. I think having the two men smile at each other is subtle and effective without feeding the audience hand-to-mouth. I also like that Mr. Fu is very jolly rather than sad— because then it is in his character to sit next to someone completely random and make a new friend."</p>
        <div class="date">October 2, 2020</div>
        <p>This week, we had a meeting to discuss changes we wanted to make to the animatic — at first choosing a transition that focused on the lazy Susan spinning faster and faster until the old man returns to the food court. Ultimately, after class, we decided to revert back to an abrupt cut to the food court. Below is a series of screenshots from our meeting notes.</p>
        <div class="imageContainer">

                <img style="width: 40%" src="assets/img/cnm/hw_6_2.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I worked on the moodboards by compiling reference photos for the characters, environments, and props. I also contributed to the asset list by inputting characters, props, and specific dishes from the Shanghai area and adding their respective descriptions. </p>
